FISHMORPH: a global database on morphological traits of freshwater fishes ,,
,,
Motivation: ,Global freshwater fish biodiversity and their responses to global changes have intensively been explored using taxonomic data, while functional aspects remain understudied due to the lack of knowledge for most species. To fill this gap, we compiled morphological traits related to locomotion and feeding for the world freshwater fish fauna based on pictures and scientific drawings available from the literature.  ,
"Main types of variables contained:,""The database includes ten morphological traits measured on 10 230 freshwater fish species, covering 59.71% of the world freshwater fish fauna."","
"Spatial location and grain:,""Global"","
"Major taxa and level of measurement: ,The database consider ray-finned
fishes (Class Actinopterygii), and measurements were made to species level.

We kindly ask the users to cite FISHMORPH as well as the source of each primary dataset in any published material produced using these data.,,
Feel free to use the FISHMORPH data, and to contact authors for details or collaborations.,,
FISHMORPH remains a work in progress so in order to help us improve the database, we encourage users to provide their feedback or querries to the primary database manager who will be happy to help. ,,
